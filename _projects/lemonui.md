LemonUI for .NET is a library for creating different types of user interfaces in Grand Theft Auto V via modding frameworks that use .NET Framework or .NET Core (ScriptHookVDotNet, RagePluginHook, RageMP and FiveM).

It was designed as a reimplementation of the well known but outdated [NativeUI](https://github.com/Guad/NativeUI) library. I was the last maintainer for NativeUI.

As of January 2025, LemonUI has more than 750.000 combined downloads across all of its download websites.

A lot of well known featured mods use LemonUI, like [Enable All Interiors](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/enable-all-interiors-wip) by HKH191, [Single Player Heists](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/single-player-heists) by HKH191, [Gang and Turf Mod](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/gang-and-turf-mod) by lucasvinbr, [LS Gangsta Mod](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/ls-gangsta-mod) by RUSMarkB and more.
