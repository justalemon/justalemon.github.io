DumpsterDiving is a mod for Grand Theft Auto V that allows you to loot almost any Dumpster in the game world for useful items... or trash... or money. It was inspired by the Dumpster Diving/Looting mechanic from Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars.

It started as a joke in the 5mods Discord server, but later ended up being implemented with the help of another community member, [Starman0620](https://www.gta5-mods.com/users/Starman0620).

DumpsterDiving is one of the mod that justified the creation of [PlayerCompanion](playercompanion).
