# Hello! I'm Lemonüçã

Hi! I'm Hannele Ruiz, also known as Lemon on the internet. I'm a software developer from Santiago, Chile.

I mainly design mods for Grand Theft Auto V for Content Creation in YouTube and Twitch, cfx.re resources for FiveM and RedM servers, Discord Bots and Websites of all kinds.

I'm also a licensed amateur radio operator under the callsign [CD3HAE](https://www.qrz.com/db/CD3HAE). I'm not that very active due to time constraints, but I sometimes check the 2m CE3AA and CE3PA repeaters on a Quansheng UV-K5 or Retevis RT-95.
