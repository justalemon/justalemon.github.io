Octi is a simple Jekyll theme that was designed and created to make a pink-and-purple style theme with a monospaced font. This theme was meant to be simple to use and navigate.

The color theme was inspired by the Rem Theme from [The Doki Theme](https://doki-theme.unthrottled.io) by [Unthrottled](https://unthrottled.io/).

Its currently a working in progress, and can be seen in the website you are browsing right now :)
